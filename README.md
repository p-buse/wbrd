## What? ##
This is a game about territory control. Players move in 4 orthogonal directions on a large grid. Each player moves one tick per turn. If a player completes a filled-in shape (definition of "filled-in" TBD), they are granted the filled-in area as captured! Whoever has the most captured area after (the whole board is captured | a timer runs out) is the winner!
